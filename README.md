“Eco-Recycling” is a web system offering recycling services for materials from temples, hospitals, industries, and
recycling companies. We collect, sort, and process materials into usable raw materials, which are then supplied to
recycling organizations to produce recycled products. Our goal is to make recycling the norm and create a better world
for future generations.
